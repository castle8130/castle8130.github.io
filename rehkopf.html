        <h1> Carson Rehkopf, LW OHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Carson Rehkopf is a big left wing that played on the Kitchener Rangers where he put up 30 goals and 29 assists in 68 games. His team made the playoffs playing 9 games in which he scored 2 goals and 4 assists. Rehkopf stands at 6'2.5" 195 lbs and skates with long clean strides. He has great skating fundamentals and looks very natural skating up the middle of the ice. There is speculation that he could make the jump from wing to center in the NHL. His length + mobility is a rare breed in the NHL. His shot is one of the best in the draft and has had scouts talking because of the velocity he gets on it. His shooting style looks like he is launching a catapult into space. If they aren't drafting in the top 20, many teams look for this type of player. He's big, strong, and a good shooter. I suspect a team selects Rehkopf anywhere from 22-38. If I were a GM, I could be convinced to draft Rehkopf around 20 for his raw tools. I lean more towards drafting him in the late 20's- early 30's because there is still a long way for his development.

            One thing I have noticed about scouting reports on Rehkopf is the lack of belief in his hockey sense. There are questions whether he has enough offensive hockey IQ to be effective in the NHL. Personally, I think Rehkopf has great offensive instincts. It's really just an issue of his body not understanding what his brain is trying to do. That is why I gave him a below average grade for playmaking/puck skills. He will identify the area of the ice he wants to pass to, but will mishandle the puck or pass behind his teammates. While his hands are soft, his hands are not quick enough for his brain. I think he needs to focus more on his overall playmaking ability and quickness to maximize his potential.

            Another attribute I love in Rehkopfs game is his skating. He isn't an elite skater at the moment, but for his size, he has high potential like Calum Ritchie. He is so smooth and has no real fundamental flaws. He is basically average in every skating ability, but his fundamentals are above average.
            
            If your team does draft Rehkopf, they are getting a toolsy player with a pro frame, good compete, good skating mechanics, and a cannon of a shot.
