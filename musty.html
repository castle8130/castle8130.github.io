        <h1> Quentin Musty, LW OHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Quentin Musty is an offensive minded left winger and assistant captain of the Sudbury Wolves. He scored 26 goals 52 assists in  53 games this year. In the postseason he scored 1 goal and 3 assists in 4 games. Musty is a big guy standing at 6'2" 200lbs. He is a heavy guy that is really hard to move off the puck. This allows him to play on the perimeter and up the middle of the ice in the offensive zone. Musty's bread and butter is his high-end vision and offensive hockey IQ. Musty is an intelligent player in the offensive zone with all the playmaking tools to succeed in the NHL. If you watch how he gets his points, his scoring is very translatable to the NHL. He doesn't take advantage of weak defenses by skating through a team. He scores by threading the needle on passes against common defensive formations you see in the NHL. A lot of scouts love the size/high-end playmaking abilities. My guess is he gets taken anywhere from 15-30 because of his polarizing attributes. I am more skeptical about his skating and compete level translating to the NHL, so I put him in the back-end of the 1st. I have him as a boom/bust player similar to Gabe Perreault and Matthew Wood.

            Quentin Musty's skating is something he really needs to work on. He is just fast enough to where it isn't an issue in juniors, but his skating is below average in almost every area. He has such heavy feet it looks like he is stuck in quick sand. His agility is alright and I have seen him comfortably move around the offensive zone evading players. The acceleration is horrible for an NHL prospect. It takes him 4-5 steps to reach his below average top speed and can be quite concerning for whoever drafts him. I still believe with a lot of work Musty can get to an NHL average pace and another positive is Musty is 17 prior to the draft and has many developmental years ahead of him.

          One other area of concern I see in Musty's game is his compete level. For a guy his size, you want to see more from his battles in the corners of the ice. He looks like he doesn't want to get his hands dirty and when he does, he gives some weak efforts. This gives me concerns about his overall impact as a future NHLer. If you don't give it your all, you aren't getting top 6 minutes. I tend to rank these boom/bust players lower than most because I prefer to draft players I have higher confidence will be long-time NHLers. If your team drafts Musty, they are getting a boom/bust top 6 forward with high-end power-play playmaking skills.
