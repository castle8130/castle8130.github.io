        <h1> Tom Willander, D SWE-Jr. </h1>
        <h2> Projected top 15 </h2>

            Tom Willander is an incredible skater that rose up draft boards after an impressive performance at the u18s with 3 goals and 5 assists in 7 games. He wasn't nearly as dominant in his regular season where he scored 4 goals and 21 assists in 39 games. He then played 6 playoff games in both the j18 and the j20 leagues where he scored 8 points (j18) and 4 points (j20) respectively. Willander is still a very raw talent and has made significant improvement over the course of the last 2 years. He is a 6'1" smooth skating defenseman that has eerily similar skating style to Cale Makar in his draft. They both have very powerful legs that cover a lot of ground and add power to their heavy wrist shots. Willander is not on the same level of Makar in his draft year as an overall player. Willander needs to involve himself more in the play and work on his attention to detail, but with such an outstanding toolkit, NHL teams are going to have a tough time passing on him. I think he will be the 2nd defenseman off the board at this point. Every year Willander has improved massively and it's tough to say he won't continue that. So my guess is he will go anywhere from 8-20.

            There are very few videos of Willander outside the u18s. I could only find the one I have linked for a shift by shift, but I was impressed by my few viewings. Willander plays defense very well. His skating allows him to keep pace with just about everyone at the j20 level. Sometimes his defensive positioning can be questionable. I noticed a few blown coverages in the games I saw, but nothing a little coaching and practice can't fix. Another nice quality about his game is his shooting ability. He has a powerful wrist shot that was on display at the u18s. When he would use it, it was mighty effective and powerful.

            My only real issues with Willander is he doesn't take enough initiative and use his high-end skating ability to dazzle in the offensive zone. He is very poised and patient, but sometimes too patient. It may just be a comfortability or confidence issue because he isn't used to his body, but thats just speculation. If he continues to improve as much as he has the past 2 years, I think he has a good chance to hit his really high offensive upside. If your team drafts Willander, they are getting a defenseman with an outstanding skating ability and limitless upside.
