        <h1> Matthew Wood, LW NCAA </h1>
        <h2> Projected top 20 </h2>

            Matthew Wood is expected to be the second player selected from the NCAA in the NHL draft after scoring 11 goals and 23 assists in 35 games. After college he played for team Canada and had instant chemistry with the 2024 projected 1st oa Macklin Celebrini where he put up 7 goals and 6 assists in 7 u18 WJC games. What stands out about Wood is his tall frame at 6'4". He is a big and heavy guy with a cannon of a shot. He is also a really creative playmaker that can make passes that most players can't. At high speed, I've seen him make some crazy intelligent passes to his teammates that you normally don't see at 18. I wouldn't describe him as a physical player, but his size makes it hard for players to push him around. He reminds me a lot of Jason Robertson because of his really odd hockey stance and rounded back while skating (with the added skill too). Players like Robertson and Vilardi have implemented their game at the NHL level while having serious skating concerns, so I'm less concerned about his NHL future (but still have lingering skepticism in my mind). Wood playing at the NCAA level and finding lots of success as a freshman is giving scouts plenty of optimism. Size? Check. Skill? Plenty of it. Compete? Check. All those boxes ticked off have put him in the 5-20 range, but I'd guess he lands around the 12ish range. Teams might be too scared because of skating concerns, but then again, look at how Jason Robertson turned out.

            Matthew Wood as a skater has people quite confused. His top speed really isn't that bad and his edge work is quite good, but his skating form is putrid. You may wonder, if it's not broke, why fix it? I think the reason to warrant concern is because bad skating form can really hault his development as a player. If he doesn't improve in the skating area of his game, his development will be hindered and I worry that it could cause him to bust. This can scare NHL teams because this type of issue is out of their control and is more of a genetic problem. No team wants this type of risk early on in the draft and on top of that, average or below average skaters have a much lower chance of excelling in the NHL playoffs. I'm more optimistic about his skating and don't think he will bust.

            Playmaking is Wood's bread and butter. He is a complete skill player with all the trademarks of an offensive weapon. He doesn't zoom around the offensive zone, but he is great at making the best hockey plays to attack the net. He has a high offensive hockey IQ and will make passes to lanes that you wouldn't even think were there. One trait of his playmaking that is really unique is that he is able to recognize the speed of his teammates and anticipate where they will be, not where they are. Another weapon he has is his shot. His shot is really hard and he is great at getting it off. He will make a few quick movements to open up shooting lanes and fire a bullet towards the net. If your team drafts him, you are getting an offensive guru with many tools.
