        <h1> Connor Bedard, C WHL</h1>
        <h2>The Projected #1 OA</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Conor Bedard is the projected #1 OA, going to the winner of the draft lottery, the Chicago Blackhawks. At the WJC-20 Bedard set the World Junior record for the most points in a single tournament with a grand total of 9 goals and 14 assists for 23 points in 7 games. This was an even better feat than his regular season. He had an incredible season with the Regina Pats by scroing 71 goals and 72 assists in 57 games in the regular season. It didn't end there... Bedard managed to put up 10 goals and 10 assists in 7 playoff games against one of the best defensive WHL hockey clubs, the Saskatoon Blades. Unfortunately, Bedard's heroics were not enough for his team to advance to the second round.

        Connor has an incredible knack for putting the puck in the net. He has very strong hips and moves his body so quickly to change his shooting angle. He is so quick and strong it is almost impossible for any defender to read properly. This is probably the best part of his offensive game because there are plenty of NHL players that have pin-point accuracy and a hard shot. The differenece between him and the others, is Connor's ability to get it off and use it effectively. If defenders try to put a stick in the way, Connor will beat them with a quick move to get into another shooting lane. If a defender tries to play the body, Connor can move to the outside and gets a quick shot on goal. He is a hard man to stop. In off-ice training, he loves to practice shooting from a variety of angles. This is what makes him so good, work ethic + talent.

          Connor isn't overly fast, but he is mighty quick. His top speed is about NHL average. The best attributes are in his acceleration and agility metrics. He uses lots of cross-overs to generate his speed and usually faces defenders head-on. I think with his work ethic, his top speed will increase a lot. I see a lot of potential with his skating becsause of his dedication to the sport.

           Bedard processes the game at a high pace. He thinks much faster than his oppenents and it makes him a deadly player. I think he was intelligent enough to play in the NHL this past year. He knows how to run a pro powerplay, has incredible offensive hockey IQ, and knows how to outplay his opponents. His defensive hockey IQ is where he needs to work on his game the most. If there is one attribute that isn't special, it's his defensive abilities. It isn't a big deal because I think he is good enough to improve in that area of his game and become a true #1 center.

             Since I combined pucks skills and playmaking, I had to give him an elite grade. This is because his puck skills are quite incredible. The guy has the puck on a string the entire game and can capitalize on any amount of given room. His hands are quick enough to get past defenders that make a wrong pivot or make a move aroud a goalie that drops to the butterfly early. As a playmaker, I think he is above average, but not elite. If I'm comparing him to players like Crosby or Mcdavid, he is far below them. He is a bit better than Auston Matthews is as a pure playmaker at the same age. I expect bedard to have just as many assists in the NHL as goals.

            Bedard might not be very tall, but he is a thick guy. At 5'10" 185lbs, Connor is a tough man to layout. The one's that try have a difficult time doing so. His low center of gravity and strong body allow him to be harder on the puck and compete against better opponents. He isn't overly physical himself, but can take a body check well. He has been dominant at every level of play, so it's hard to down-play his compete level. I'm sure he will do just fine entering the NHL.
