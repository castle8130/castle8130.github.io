        <h1> Oliver Moore, C USNTDP</h1>
        <h2> Projected top 25 pick </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            The hard working speedster, Oliver Moore, played for the USNTDP this year and scored 31 goals and 44 assists in 61 games. He played in the u18s where he put up 4 goals and 5 assists in 7 games. Moore is known as one of, if not, the best skaters in the draft. He plays center and plays a very translatable center style of play. I think he utilizes his speed well and plays the position proficiently. He plays the game at a fast pace and loves to compete. He puts his nose to the grind stone and battles when it is needed. He will always give his best effort and is someone I can see being a PK guy. I see Moore as a grinder more than an offensive weapon that some others do. He has a good NHL shot and some good stickhandling abilities, but the real question is how do people see him as an offensive weapon? The ones that are bullish on his offensive upside rank him in the 8-16 range. The scouts that view him like I do, will rank him in the 17-25 range and are much more bearish. I think him being a bit shorter and not providing much size down the middle is another reason for some teams to drop him down their draft boards.

            Moore is a hard player to contain. He has a really good burst in his acceleration followed by a great top speed. He can skate around the offensive zone for days and be a constant threat. He uses his edge work to beat the opposition in one on one battles and take control of the puck. When it comes to the offensive side of things, I don't think Moore is a great playmaker. Quite the opposite in fact. I have seen him miss a lot of basic offensive passing plays that would result in high-scoring chances. He doesn't have that keen playmaking sense that top 6 centers almost always have. Unless the pass is an obvious one, Moore doesn't have the ability to make high level plays at full speed. He also doesn't slow the play down to capitalize enough. I think if he can work on his creativity and playmaking skills, he can become that 2C that teams want from him. I just don't see that from him at this moment.

          Some more positives for Moore is his shooting ability. He has strong legs and uses his speed to get lots of momentum on the puck. His shooting is derived a lot from his skating. He shoots a lot from the tops of the circles on the power play and 5v5. His accuracy is mediocre, but sometimes he will label his shots in the top corner. His competitive dirve is also a positive. He never gives up and is a hard worker in the corners. If your team drafts Moore, they are getting a hard working high-level skater that provides proficient work at 5v5.
