        <h1> Samuel Honzek, LW WHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected in the top 25 </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Samuel Honzek is a big Slovak standing at 6'3" 195 lbs that produced 23 goals and 33 assists in 43 WHL games. The giants fell hard in the playoffs playing only 4 games where Honzek produced 1 goal and 3 assists. Honzek played on the left wing this year, but there are some rumors that he could play center in the NHL. It only makes sense because he is so big and plays really well in the center of the ice. Honzek skates efficiently for his size and has a strong stick at all times. A quick glance at Honzek's play and the skill is evident. With his size + skill combo, he likely doesn't last long in the 1st round. Based on what I have been reading from a variety of sources, scouts have been raving about his size, strength, and skill. I project him to be taken in the 9-22 range. I personally lean towards the late teens and would need to see more offensive flash to put him in my top 15.

            Honzek's skating ability is about as average as it gets. I think his side to side movement is his best skating strength, but it's just a hair above average. Honzek has thick hips and legs that he uses for balancing steadily. It is a hard feat to push Honzek to the outside and that is an intriguing trait for a team that wants to lessen their perimeter play. If you were looking at how to build an NHL team based on this year's Stanley Cup winner, Honzek is the type of player that fits this mold. Vegas had a lot of decently mobile, big, and heavy forwards with some skill. Thats is Honzek's description to a tee. On the offensive side of the puck, his biggest strength is his hockey IQ. When it comes to attacking the net, he is intelligent and can read difficult situations well. His puck skills are good, but they arren't special compared to other 1st round prospects.

           If your team drafts Honzek, they are getting a sizeable forward with lots of skill and projects as a top 6 forward.
