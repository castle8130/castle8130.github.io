        <h1> Bradly Nadeau, LW BCHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Bradley Nadeau took care of bussiness this season by leading his team in points with 45 goals and 68 assists in 54 games. He didn't stop there... After dominating the regular season, Nadeau scored 17 goals and 18 assists in 17 games to claim the Fred Page cup. It's really hard to take much away from his fantastic season because he was clearly too good for that league. Similar to Tyson Jost and Alex Newhook, Nadeau  is a hard player to scout and will need to make many adjustments to compete at the NCAA level. Nadeau's best attributes are in his speed and his shot. He is a pure shooter that can absolutely rifle pucks. I know I have listed many players with a strong ability to shoot, but Nadeau is up there with Connor Bedard. Scouts have got to like the skill/speed combination they see in him even if he is a hair above 5'10". My guess is he will be drafted somewhere between 20-40. It is a wide range because of his size and inexperience at higher compete levels. Teams may not want to risk getting a player that hasn't played against any real competition. With Nadeau there is so much upside that I would be willing to take him as early as 20 and as late as 28.

            Nadeau's skating is elusive and fast. He blazes through the competition with a high-end motor and great top speed. His edgework isn't overly good, but the speed is going to do him wonders in college next year. I think his side to side movement is about NHL average. It's nothing to worry about and I can see him improving in that area. He always looks like such a natural skater on the ice. His steady balance keeps him in line to one time the puck effectively. He lines up on the left circle on the powerplay for his dangerous one-timers. His wrist shot and one timers will beat goalies clean in the NHL. He is always a danger as a true offensive dynamo.

          If I had to point out some concerns I have for Nadeau, it would be in his compete level and defensive awareness. I see him using his motor and trying his best out there at all times, I'll give him that. It really comes down to how he will play against better competition. If he struggles at Maine next year, was this all a hoax because the BCHL is such a soft league? Will the physicality be too much for him? You never know with these BCHL kids. Jost and Newhook haven't lived up to their expectations. We will have to wait and see. If you team drafts Nadeau, you are getting a high-upside skill player that plays on the 1st power-play unit.
