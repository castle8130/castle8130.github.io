        <h1> Macklin Celebrini, C NCAA</h1>
        <h2> 1st OA </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Macklin Celebrini is the sure-fire 1st OA talent in this draft. He has proven to all scouts that he is above everyone in this draft class. I have not heard from any scouts that he is not the best player in this draft. He follows a similar path to that of Adam Fantilli. Celebrini dominated the USHL last year and tore up the NCAA in his draft season this year. He scored 32 goals 32 assists in 38 games as a 17 year old (June Birthday). He participated in the WJC-20 on a weak Team Canada and was by far their best player. He put up 4 goals and 4 assists in 5 games. He is a great 1st overall talent that will make the San Jose Sharks very happy. His style of play is eerily similar to that of Sidney Crosby. He isn't the same caliber of prospect Crosby was just to be clear. His hockey IQ and mature 200 foot play is where most of the similarities lie. On top of that, his skating style and build is reminiscent of Crosby. He is an all-around terrific player that has very good offense, but not game-breaking. The Sharks were lucky to get the 1st pick and avoid the headaches of picking in the lottery range.

            Celebrini plays a hard-working non-complicated style of offense. He isn't very creative or crafty, but he is really smart and really knows how to use his edge work to open up his hips. He is incredibly competitive to the point where I'd feel comfortable putting him up against any opponent. He has that Nico Hischier level of compete style with better tools. He doesn't stop moving his feet and is great at anticipating pucks. His head is always on a swivel to find the open guy. He might not create a whole lot of space, but he is really good at finding the open man. Plays like a true leader that his teammates can follow.

            His skating ability is between Average to Above Average. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. His edge work is really good. He can use 10-2 style to get better angles when attacking the opponent's net. His outside edges are also impressive when he has to face away from pressure in the dirty areas of the ice. His acceleration and top speed are good as well. I don't see any analysts raving about his speed or acceleration and I don't see it as anything outstanding.

          Caelebrini has one heck of a shot. He has a howitzer of a one-timer. In the Frozen Four semi-finals Denver was doing their best to lock Celebrini up. There were a few shifts where he got loose and ripped a few shots that luckily for Denver went wide. He is a lethal force on the power play and likely plays at the top of the circle for one-timers. His shots are incredibly powerful and accurate. He has one of the best shots in the draft, that is a gurantee!
