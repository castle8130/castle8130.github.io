        <h1> My 2024 1st round Mock Draft </h1>
        <h2> Start of the draft</h2>
        
        
        <p>
           
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        
            <li> <b> Macklin Celebrini, San Jose Sharks </b></li>
            
            <p> No brainer, best player available </p>
            
            <li> <b> Artyom Levshunov, Chicago Blackhawks </b></li>
            
            <p> The Blackhawks look to be leaning towards Levshunov at the combine. He is considered a more safe pick than anything.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Anton Silayev, Anaheim Ducks </b></li>
            
            <p> After last draft, I feel Verbeek prefers his players that are playing at a higher competitive level early on. That screams Silayev.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Cayden Lindstrom, Columbus Blue Jackets </b></li>
            
            <p> I'm unsure of what the Blue Jackets want to do here. Lindstrom looks like the type of player the Jackets usually go for, so he goes here.</p>
            
            <li><b> Ivan Demidov, Montreal Canadiens</b></li>
            
            <p> Given the opportunity to draft Demidov, I think the Canadiens take it here. Demidov is the most skilled player in the draft and lights out electric.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Carter Yakemchuk, Arizona Coyotes </b></li>
            
        <p> Given Arizonas recent draft history, the Coyotes want to be bigger and stronger than their opponents. At 6th oa there are still two players available that fit the bill, Yakemchuk and Sennecke. They take Yakemchuk here. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Zeev Buium, Ottawa Senators </b></li>
            
            <p> For the most part, Ottawa has been very good at hitting on top draft picks. I think they see Zeev as the best available when deciding between Zeev and Zayne.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Zayne Parekh ,Seattle Kraken </b></li>
            
            <p> The few defensemen Seattle has drafted in the top 3 rounds of the draft so far are on the smaller side. I don't think they see size as an issue in their scouting regimen. They debate between Zayne and Berkly, but go with a defenseman they really need.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Tij Iginla, Calgary Flames</b></li>
            
            <p> There is just no way I'm not picking Tij for the Flames. He makes too much sense. </p>
            
            
            <li> <b> Sam Dickinson, New Jersey Devils</b></li>
            
            <p> This pick is likely to get traded on draft day and I assume it does. Dickinson, Berkly, and Sennecke are heavily debated here. All 3 have a strong case. I go with a defenseman because it is such a luxury to have a gifted mobile player like Dickinson. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Beckett Sennecke, Buffalo Sabres </b></li>
            
            <p> Another likely traded pick on draft day. Sennecke has gotten an incredible amount of praise for his OHL end of regular season and playoff performance. Buffalo could use another forward with size and high-end upside.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Berkly Catton, Philadelphia Flyers </b></li>
            
            <p> This is a dream scenario for Philly. An elite play driver and creator that can boost an offenses top 6. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Stian Solberg, Minnesota Wild </b></li>
            
            <p> My gut tells me Minnesota wants a defenseman and I think Solberg is the guy. He flashed in the World Championships for team Norway and plays a very hard hitting style GM's covet. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Konsta Helenius, San Jose Sharks </b></li>
            
            <p> San Jose would love to get their hands on a defenseman here, but there aren't any to really choose from. I'll say Konsta Helenius because he's the best player available. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Jett Luchanko, Detroit Red Wings </b></li>
            
            <p> Detroit has been hyper-focused on competitive type players in the past few drafts. They keep hammering out those premium positions by adding yet another top 20 pick at the Center position.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Trevor Connelly, St Louis Blues</b></li>
            
            <p> Trevor has been absolutely dynamic this year in the USHL. A few teams have him on a Do Not Draft list, but St Louis doesn't pass-up the uber talented American. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Yegor Surin, Washington Capitals</b></li>
            
            <p> Yegor is a skilled and competitive type of player that brings a raw physical element to the table. He is a powerful player that can be inconsistent, but is well worth the draft capital. Washington takes the Russian here</p>
            
            <li> <b> Michael Hage, Chicago Blackhawks</b></li>
            
            <p> Hage is a skill player that plays a style similar to Berkly Catton. He is very good at creating space for teammates while also having a dynamic skating ability. The Hawks pounce on the Chicago Steel kid here.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Michael Brandsegg Nygard, Vegas Golden Knights</b></li>
            
            <p> Michael is a two-way forward with a knack for goal scoring. It's hard to picture him going too much further than this on draft day due to his play against men this year. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Adam Jiricek, New York Islanders </b></li>
            
            <p> The Islanders play a fast defensive style of game that I see Jiricek playing in the NHL. I see Jiricek falling into this range due to the limited time he played this season. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Cole Eiserman, Los Angeles Kings </b></li>
            
            <p> The kings grab the falling Cole Eiserman. He likely goes a little higher than this on draft day due to some of the believers in his ability. </p>
            
            
            <li> <b> Dominik Badinka, Nashville Predators </b></li>
            
            <p> Nashville drafted the highly touted defensive defenseman Tanner Molendyk last year. I think they take another shot at a mobile defenseive defenseman in Badinka.</p>
            
            <li> <b> EJ Emery, Toronto Maple Leafs </b></li>
            
            <p> The Leafs could really use a defensive minded player as athletic as Emery. It's hard to predict the style of player they prefer based on draft history.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Igor Chernyshov, Colorado Avalanche </b></li>
            
            <p> The Aves aren't afraid of drafting Russians. They do so here by drafting the explosive Russian Igor.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Cole Beaudoin, Ottawa Senators</b></li>
            
            <p> Cole showed a high compete level at the WJC-18's. He gives the Senators a good future 3rd line shutdown center. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Sacha Boisvert, Montreal Canadiens </b></li>
            
            <p> Boisvert has been getting some praise from NHL scouts and I'm still a little skeptical about it. I have him going to the Canadiens here.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Julius Miettinen, Carolina Hurricanes</b></li>
            
            <p> Carolina loves their Finnish players and Julius brings a very sound two-way game to the table. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Leo Sahlin Walleinus, Calgary Flames </b></li>
            
            <p> If Calgary decides to go forward at 9, they have to get a defenseman out of this very talented 2024 defense pool. They go with one of the best skating defensemen in Leo. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Liam Greentree, Dallas Stars</b></li>
            
            <p> The Stars are lucky to snag a falling player in Liam Greentree after his dissappointing WJC-18. The Stars don't panic over 1 tournament. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Linus Eriksson, New York Rangers </b></li>
            
            <p> Linus Eriksson is the best two-way center you can get. The Rangers jump on him here. </p>
            
            <li> <b> Emil Hemming, Anaheim Ducks </b></li>
            
            <p> The Ducks aim for a goal scoring winger and there is no-one left better than Hemming.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Charlie Elick, Philadelphia Flyers</b></li>
            
            <p> A big smooth skating defenseman that has wowed scouts with his tools. </p>
