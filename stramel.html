        <h1> Charlie Stramel, C NCAA </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Charlie Stramel played in the NCAA this year on Wisconsin where he provided physicality and speed producing 5 goals and 7 assists in 33 games. The Wisconsin Badgers weren't a great team, but scouts held Stramel to a higher standard from what he produced this year. He is a big bulldozing machine standing at 6'3" and 222lbs. His size, speed, and physical presence will provide any NHL team the energy they need to get back into games. I see him as a bottom 6 energy player at the NHL level. I wasn't that impressed with his offensive skills in the games I watched of him. My guess is he goes anywhere between 23-40 because of how "safe" of a player he is. I am not very keen on drafting players for bottom 6 roles in the top 25, so I placed him more towards the back of the 1st round.

            Stramel shares a lot of similarities to Brindley. They are both fast, physical, play in the NCAA, and have gone through the USNTDP. However, Stramel is a bit bigger and doesn't provide many offensive skills. His hockey IQ is poor and I don't see him playing on the powerplay at the NHL level. Maybe as a net front presence, but I don't trust his puckhandling abilities. He has a strong shot due to his size and he is good at getting it off. I've seen him make poor decisions with the puck and he can be a chemistry killer at times. He doesn't position himself for success, but he gives an honest effort to keep pace with the oppositions faster players. If your team drafts Stramel, they are getting a physical player that can be a really effective 3rd or 4th line energy guy.
