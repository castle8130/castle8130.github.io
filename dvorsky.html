        <h1> Dalibor Dvorsky, C HockeyAllsvenskan </h1>
        <h2> Projected top 10 </h2>

            Dalibor Dvorsky is a puck hounding Slovak that played center in Sweden's tier 2 league in which he produced 6 goals and 8 assists in 38 games. He later played in the playoffs and did not record any points in 7 games. However he did play in Sweden's U20 division and scored 10 goals and 11 assists in just 10 regular season games. Then he scored 3 goals and 1 assist in the playoffs for u20. After this, he played at the U18s leading his team with 8 goals and 5 assists in 7 games. As you can see, Dvorsky is dominant against his own age group, but still needs to fine tune a few things to produce against men. A lot of independent scouting services lowered Dvorsky on their ranings due to his poor performances against grown men, but then rose his ranking after his phenomenal u18 performance. Now lets breakdown the good part of Dvorskys game. Dvorsky is a responsible two way center that gives an insane amount of effort each given night. He is always on the puck with his quick legs and doesn't fear any opponent. I think he is the most competitive player in the draft aside from Bedard because there is simply no quit in him and he is quick (not fast). Offensively he is more of a scorer than playmaker. He has a powerful wrist shot and can lineup on the right dot (facing the net) on the power play for one timers. I am not convinced he will be on the power-play in the NHL because he isn't very creative, but I think there is a chance. I assume most NHL teams have him ranked in the 4-12 range based on what I have heard, but I am not a direct source to any true NHL scouts. I have Dvorsky as #9 and I am conflicted at times. Sometimes I see him as the next Barkov and other times I see him as a Dylan Strome or Kotkaniemi type. So I just added him in the beginning of my next tier of players.

           Dvorsky's love for the game really gives me hope. He wants to win every game and does anything he can to do it. His skating is the biggest part of his game I have a problem with. His legs move very fast, but he doesn't go anywhere. There is very little to no power in his skating and I think it might be more technique related than strength related. I'm not an expert on skating strides, but when I see his stride, I often don't see full extension and when I do, it looks awkward. Now this could be how his body just naturally lies and genetic (which would be really bad) or it could be a simple mechanical issues. I am optimistic because of how dedicated he is and talented in other areas of the game. If your team drafts Dvorsky, you are looking at a projectible two-way goal scoring #2 center. A guy that projects as a 50 point scorer with more goals than assists and can play the PK.
