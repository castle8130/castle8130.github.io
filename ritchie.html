        <h1> Calum Ritchie, C OHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st rounder </h2>

            Calum Ritchie is a center prospect from the Oshawa Generals that started his season off with a bang by leading team Canada in scoring at the Hlinka Gretzky with 10 points in 5 games. He was less impressive in the regular season, but was still one of the better players on his team when he scored 59 points in 59 games. His team made the playoffs, but made a quick exit. He was only able to muster up 6 points in 5 games. After all that, he played 7 games at the u18s and put up 9 points. Some scouts were less impressed with his u18 performance and question his compete level. I think there were just too many expectations for a very unorganized team Canada. They were sloppy and didn't have any real chemistry. They played with each other for maybe a week before the tournament and had multiple add-ons throughout. When watching him, there isn't one thing that really stands out to me about Ritchie. I gave him an average grade in all areas of the game, but there are some categories that are close to above average and some that are closer to below. One example of a close to above average grade is his skating. Ritchie is a smooth skater and is a natural center. He has an attractive mobility to him for being 6'2" and has a beautiful form. I think with added muscle and practice, his skating could reach new peaks. My guess is scouts are very aware of his potential, his toolbox, and ideal mold as a center. So I think he will go in the 13-30 range. I'm not a firm believer in him becoming an elite player, so I have him in the 20s.

            As an offensive player, Ritchie's strength relies on his hockey sense. His offensive hockey sense consistently contributes to him being in the right place at the right time. He is always floating in a direction that gives his teammates an option to pass to. His playmaking ability is another quality of his game that brings his offensive game to another level. He has really smooth hands that deliver endless crisp passes to his teammates. I had to rank him average in the playmaking area of the game because his puck skills overall are just okay and from time to time he will mess up some of his passes.

            Some critiques I have for Ritchie is in the finishing part of his game. He generates a lot more high danger chances than what he is credited for on the score sheet. He is a below average capitalizer and can annoy you as a fan. He will create and get the puck into the slot just for him to fail again. Another critique is in his strength. For starters, he isn't good at board battles. He is physically weak for a guy his size and doesn't win as many board battles as you'd want him to. His strength issues are a big reason for why he is considered a perimeter player. He is not strong enough to take space in the middle of the ice. This can be a red flag for NHL teams that don't think he is capable of playing the game in the dirty areas. If your team drafts Ritchie, they are getting a smooth skating center with all the potential to be a top 6 center (he has a long way to go and requires really good development).
