        <h1> Ryan Leonard, RW USNTDP</h1>
        <h2> Projected top 10 </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Ryan had a terrific season this year with the USNTDP scoring 51 goals and 43 assists in 57 games. He scored the game winning goal in OT to win gold for the US. He scored 8 goals and 9 assists in 7 games at the u18s. He was their best goal scorer and plays with a physical edge. If you like the Tkachuk brothers, you would very much like Ryan. He stands just shy of 6'0" and brings a tenacity that doesn't quit. He is a coaches dream player with the raw physical tools. I'd describe him as a skill player that gives hard body checks and can play defensively too. I have heard some talk that he could be moved to center like Gauthier from the last draft. I am not sure he will make the move, but I love that this is even a possibility for him. I can see him getting consideration as early as 3rd overall and maybe even 2nd, but thats my  personal opinion. My expectations are he gets drafted in the 3-7 range and anything outside of that would really surprise me. He isn't overly creative as a playmaker and his puck skills are about NHL average (closer to above average than below). He still makes plenty of great passing plays and can play with high level playmakers well.

            His skating ability is pretty average with an above average top speed and middling agility and acceleration abilities. Given that he brings physicality, I think his skating is an overall plus. The physicality combined with speed is such an asset, especially if you look at how teams use that combination in the playoffs. As for his other tools, he is a great shooter, has great physicality/compete, an average hockey IQ (closer to above), and average playmaking/puck skills (closer to above). From a pure long-term projection I really feel like he could be in competition with Fantilli at #2, but he hasn't played as high level of competition as the players ranked above him, so I had to put him at #6. If your team drafts Leonard, you are getting a high-end goal scoring winger that brings a physical presence.
