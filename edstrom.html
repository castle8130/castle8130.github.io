        <h1> David Edstrom, C SWEHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected in the top 25 </h2>

            David Edstrom is a well rounded center that played most of his season in the J20 level where he scored 15 goals and 13 assists in 28 games. He also played in the Swedish hockey league where he put up 2 goals and 2 assists in 11 games. Following this performance, he joined team Sweden at the u18s and played a shutdown role playing against the best lines of the opposition.  His stats there were 5 goals, 3 assists, and a +12 in 7 games. Edstrom shows all the key attributes teams look for in a center. He is incredibly responsible in his own end for an 18 year old by shutting down the best players on the opposing side. I see a lot of attributes in him that are similar to players like William Karlsson, Roope Hintz, and Jonathan Toews. A more recent comparable would be Anton Lundell fromt he 2020 draft. He plays the game the right way by going to the dirty areas and competing hard against the opposition. He has some really high-end defensive hockey IQ for a center that NHL teams look for. I think if all goes well for him, he could be a #2c (or a #1c) that doesn't put up too many points. The value he has in the draft probably has him going somewhere between 15-25. I'd be surprised if he slips past that due to his mature play.

            As a skater, David Edstrom has an above average NHL speed with great technique. He covers a lot of ground with his long legs and clean stride. His acceleration is a bit above average and his edge work/agility is about average. His overall skating ability had me put him at average, but he leans closer to the above average side. When it comes to the offensive side of things, Edstrom plays a very simple game. Pass to the guy thats open, try to shoot the puck in the slot, and go to the net for tips and screens. He doesn't play a modern style of offense and isn't overly creative. This is why his offensive upside is hindered a bit. I still think he can involve himself well in the NHL and find various forms of success offensively, but there are limited places he can be put on the power-play.

            If your team does draft Edstrom, you are getting a shutdown center that can play effectively on the PK and score goals at 5v5.
