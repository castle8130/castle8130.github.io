        <h1> Andrew Gibson, D OHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 2nd-3rd round </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Andrew Gibson played for the SOO Greyhounds this season where he scored 7 goals and 14 assists in 45 games. The team was awful this year and he was the teams best defenseman. He was given the toughest matchups all year and of all players on the team with more than 40 games played, Gibson had the best +/- with a -4. After the season, he played for team Canada at the WJC where he had 3 assists in 7 games with a +5. He was the teams best defenseman by playing a well-rounded game. Coming into the season, Gibson was thought of as an offensive force on the blue line. He crushed it in the NOJHL the season prior where he scored 21 goals 30 assists in 40 games. This year he played a more defensive defenseman role. He is great at using his body effectively. Whether that's blocing shots or using his body to roll out forwards along the boards. His mature play and big frame (6'3") has really impressed me. I think if he were on a better team, most people would be putting him in the 1st round. My guess is he goes in the middle-late 2nd round. I am much higher on him than any consensus list I've seen. I might be out to lunch, but I see Gibson as a 1st round talent.

            Andrew Gibson is a big and heavy set player just shy of 200lbs. He has great mobility for his solid size. He is a fantastic skater in transition and consistently gives accurate crisp passes to his forwards on breakouts. In the offensive zone he is very conservative with his positioning and uses a powerful wrist shot from the blue-line. It doesn't take much effort from Gibson to get a lot on his shot. His shot is heavy and he is dangerously good at getting it through traffic. His offensive skills didn't shine much this year, but his team was not the greatest to say the least. While his team played poorly, I do not see Gibson on the power play in the NHL. Although, I see his offensive skills working well at 5v5 and a player who could potentially score 40-50 points in a single season.

            From the defensive side of the puck, I love Gibsons game. He is great at man on man coverage. The gap control coupled with his instincts to pinch are top notch. He is terrific at using his body and weight to push players around. Sometimes he can get caught puck watching, but I find this to be a minor issue in Gibsons game. Puck watching is a trait that can be coached around and he doesn't do it too often. I am very high on his defensive game and believe he can be a 2nd pairing guy. If your team drafts Gibson, they are getting a two-way defender that can kill penalties and potentially slot in to your top 4.
