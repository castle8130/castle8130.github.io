        <h1> Oliver Bonk, D OHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Oliver Bonk is a mobile defenseman that played for the London Knights and scored 10 goals 30 assists in 67 games with a +17. He then played 21 playoff games where he added 11 assists and a +8. Oliver is the son of former NHLer Radek Bonk and has his fathers frame standing near 6'2" 180lbs. He doesn't give you much of a "wow" factor when you watch him, but he has great projectability to the NHL. He plays a great two-way game and has good puck moving skills. Any chance Bonk gets, he will skate the puck into the offensive zone himself and he is very elusive at that. His big frame and mobility has excited a lot of NHL scouts. Per Pronman's interviews there's talk of Bonk getting drafted way earlier than most people expect. As early as a top 20 pick. He is everything NHL teams covet this time of year; big, strong, mobile, and projectable NHLer. This doesn't surprise me all too much, but I'm more hesitant with Bonk because I think his upside is limited.

            Bonk is a good, not great skater. He has mobile hips that give him strong puck carrying skills. He is elusive enough to get into the zone and setup plays. Bonk's playmaking is very vanilla. Get posession of the puck, get it into the offensive zone with control, and cleanly hand it over to his teammates. You won't be dazzled by Bonk and he won't be used to score many NHL points, but he is always doing the right things. The one offensive trait I can see Bonk using well in the NHL is his shot. He gets a ton of power on his one-timer. His shot is a beauty that will be used well for any team entering the playoffs. He has that mindset of one-timing point shots to the net for tips and deflections. Other than that I don't see a ton of offensive potential in his playmaking because he makes the simple pass, not creative ones.

            Oliver has real potential on the defensive side of the puck. The guy weighed only 180 lbs at the combine, but plays like he is 200lbs. He is smart with his weight placement in corner battles and I have found that he plays a mature defensive game. He cleanly rolls out forwards along the boards, he plays the defensive side when he needs to, and for the most part, is positioned correctly. This is the part of the game that NHL teams love to look at. Does he play a pro level defense? As he gets bigger, how much further can he develop? Does he make good decisions with the puck under pressure? Bonk checks off a lot of these boxes and I bet there are a lot of teams that project him as a 2nd pairing guy. I can see this too and project him as a #4-5 guy with the upside of a #2-3. If your team drafts Bonk, they are getting a big mobile puck-carrying defenseman with strong defensive qualities.
