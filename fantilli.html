        <h1> Adam Fantilli, C NCAA</h1>
        <h2> Projected top 5</h2>

            Adam Fantilli just put up one of the best seasons by an 18 year old freshman in college history. He scored 30 goals and 35 assists in 36 college games. He played for Canada in the WJC-20, putting up 5 points in 7 games and most recently played at the World Championships and put up 3 points in 10 games. According to Bob Mckenzie's scouts, there were a few scouts that felt Fantilli wasn't the second best player in the draft. I think this is a fair assesment due to how Fantilli stacks up against Smith and Carlsson. He won the Hobey Baker award and two gold medals for Canada, so whats not to love? Well here is the case of why scouts feel he is not second best. Usually when I look at a prospects faults, I pray it's not their skating because if there is something that holds back talent the most, it's skating issues. Thankfully, that is not Fantilli's issue. He is a good skater, but doesn't dazzle you with it. Fantilli's biggest long term issues are in his playmaking in the offensive zone. I think he has a below average playmaking ability and when you think of offensive dynamos in the NHL, playmaking is one of the strongest parts of their games. When I watch him, I just don't see him create space for teammates or make the best pass in real time (at a fast pace). He gets past players with his elite puck skills and intensity. His playmaking combined with an average skating ability is the reason I question his offensive upside and ultimately put him at 4th oa. Having said that, he likely goes 2nd oa.

            Fantilli is a taller player at 6'2" and loves to use his wheels. He is a hard worker with good character. A report I read claimed that his team couldn't get him away from the treadmill. When I watch him play, this adds up because he is zooming out there and never seems to get tired. His top speed is above the NHL average, but his edgework and agility aren't anything special. And by "not anything special" I don't mean it's holding him back. I mean he isn't going to be using those skills to do anything too extraordinary. I was close to giving him an above average grade, but I think his overall skating ability made me want more from him.

          As a shooter, Fantilli is phenomenal. To score near a goal per game pace as an 18 year old freshman in college is quite impressive. On the power play he sits on the right side (facing the net) as a left hand shot. He has a scoring ability similar to Kyle Connor had in college. Different overall play style, but similar goal scoring style. He always lines himself up to be a scoring threat. Anytime teams gave him too much space, Fantilli would capitalize. His seeing eye wrist shot has NHL sniper written all over it. On top of that, he has a great one-timer as well. A strong, powerful shot that can beat NHL goalies. I think his goal scoring ability might be his strongest attribute along with his work ethic and speed.
