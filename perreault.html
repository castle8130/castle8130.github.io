        <h1> Gabe Perreault, RW USNTDP </h1>
        <h2> Projected in the top 25 </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Gabe Perreault is a highly intelligent player that played for the USNTDP this year and scored 53 goals and 79 assists in 63 games shattering the records held by Matthews, Jack Hughes, and Patrick Kane for single season points in USNTDP history. This high level skill player also posted great numbers at the u18s scoring 5 goals and 13 assists in 7 games. These incredible numbers showcase how talented Gabe really is. He is an amazing playmaker and knows how to attack the net similarly to Smith. His high level IQ paired with unreal puck skills make him one of the most dangerous playmaking prospects. He always knows where his teammates are and efficiently capitalizes on any given room to him. His unique puck skills create space for him and slow the game down. If a high-end skill play is needed to score a goal, Perreault will dazzle you. On top of this, Perreault is great in his own end. He is a responsible two-way forward that back checks efficiently and provides excellent coverage. I think he will be drafted anywhere from #8-#25. I have ranked him somewhere in between at 15, but that may change due to his high-end upside.

           Given everything I said above, he is a polarizing player because his skating ability isn't the best. When I first watched Perreault, I wasn't a huge fan. I saw him play against a USHL team where he was quite inefficient and turned the puck over frequently. He couldn't keep up with the pace of play and had to rely on his smarts to activate himself in the offensive zone. After watching him at the u18s, his skills and upside were far more prevalent. Perreault was a big standout and displayed excellent high-end skill that I only got glimpses of in my first few viewings. He is very smart and postions himself stealthily for offensive scoring chances. In the defensive zone, he shows willingness to go after the offensive opposition. He isn't a physical player, but he uses his high IQ to be effective in all areas of the ice. I gave him an average grade for compete/physicality because while he does give more effort than the average prospect, I question how he performs in higher competitive levels. If your team drafts Perreault, they are getting a smart skilled two-way winger that plays on the top powerplay unit.
