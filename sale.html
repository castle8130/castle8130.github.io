        <h1> Eduard Sale, RW CZE </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Eduard Sale is a right winger that played in the Czech Pro league where he scored 7 goals 7 assists in 43 games. He then played in the playoffs where he produced no points in 6 games. After that, he played at the u18s where he scored 4 goals 2 assists in 5 games. Sale has had a lot of criticism for his compete level and some very optimistic views on his high-end skill by Craig Button. He is truly a mixed bag and I've heard rumblings that his consistency is a huge issue. At times he will skate with intensity and there will be times he just dissapears. When the puck is on his stick, he incredibly skilled and always makes the right play. He is a good capitalizer and can be very sneaky at times. Whether thats for backdoor tap-ins or coasting behind the opposing defenders. The scouting community seems to be pretty polarized with him. I can see teams wanting him as early as 22 and as late as 38. I am not very optimistic with what I have heard and seen from Sale, so I ranked him at the end of my first round.

            Eduard Sale has the skill of a 1st round prospect. The way he is able to take initiative in the offensive zone when there is open space is something every NHL team needs. A guy that can capitalize and give his teammates prime opportunities. His shooting ability is above average. The way he changes the angle of where he shoots from and his accuracy is top notch. The shot power he has is also decent. It really comes down to how often he engages himself into the play. There will be multiple shifts in a row where he will be playing with almost no direct impact on the ice. He will be standing still on the ice (in the right position albeit) and doesn't move until the play gets to him. Standing still on the ice isn't something you do too often in the NHL because even if you are in a good position, players will easily catch up to you and you have limited impact on the future of that play. This is why Sale gives me Alexis Lafreniere vibes. Two players that don't give an honest effort, but have high-level skill and intelligence.

            Sale was a hard player to project due to his unique style. He already competes against men and makes very mature plays for his age. As a skater, Sale is pretty average. He doesn't wow you at all, but can keep up the pace in the czech league. Everytime I watch him, I wanted a bit more from him. I see him as a 3rd line winger in the NHL that produces average numbers, but has the potential to be a top 6 guy. If your team drafts Sale, they are getting a smart and skilled forward that will fit in the top 9 forward group of your NHL roster (pretty soon).
