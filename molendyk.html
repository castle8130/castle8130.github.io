        <h1> Tanner Molendyk, D WHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Tanner Molendyk is the smooth skating shutdown defenseman from the Saskatoon Blades. He scored 9 goals 28 assists in 67 games this year with a +31. In the playoffs he had 3 goals 5 assists in 18 games and a +2. Coming into the year Molendyk was thought of as an offensive defenseman. He didn't meet those expectations this year, but instead developed a strong two-way ability. He was given assignments to stop the oppositions best players and was successful in doing so against Connor Bedard during the regular season. When watching him play, the one skill that sticks out is Molendyk's phenomenal skating ability. He skates effortlessly accross the ice with his insanely good edgework and cross-overs. He can keep up with just about any forwards in the WHL too. The overall package Molendyk brings is unique and has scouts polarized on how he projects as an NHL player. Some are very high on his skating ability and can see him being a top 4 two-way defender. Some are worried Molendyk is too small to play a shutdown role and if he isn't on the powerplay, there is no good projection to the NHL for him. Molendyk should be taken anywhere from 22-40. I am somewhere in the middle.

            Tanner has insanely good skating fundamentals that get him to his top speed quicker than players can think. His top speed is just average, but his skating elsewhere is terrific. Sometimes I see Molendyk play a little wreckless on the ice because he knows he can catch up to his opponents through his great skating ability and I don't see this translating well in the NHL. Defensively, he is one of the best one on one defenders in the draft class. Forwards struggle a lot on the rush because of Molendyk's fantastic skating + gap control combination. I do worry about Molendyk's in-zone defensive play because at times I see him get outmuscled. This is concering because he is a smaller defender to begin with and relied upon to be a defensive defenseman.

            Molendyk thrives in transition. He is great at taking the puck away and gaining a head of steam through the neutral zone. He gets a lot of his points by setting his teammates up for success on the rush. When the puck is on his stick, his puck management skills can be questionable. The rate at which he turns the puck over to the other team is concering me about his offensive upside. I find that his vision/decision making isn't what you want out of a 1st round prospect. He both contributes to taking the puck from the opposition and giving it away. I think he is a huge net positive of a player, but pro projection is tricky. If your team drafts Molendyk, they are getting a two-way 5v5 defenseman that skates like the wind and can be a top 4 defenseman for your team.
