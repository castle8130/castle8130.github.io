        <h1> My 2023 1st round Mock Draft </h1>
        <h2> Start of the draft</h2>
        
        
        <p>
           
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        
            <li> <b> Connor Bedard, Chicago Blackhawks </b></li>
            
            <p> I think this is a lock. The Blackhawks get the best prospect since Mcdavid.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Adam Fantilli, Anaheim Ducks </b></li>
            
            <p> I'm 6/10 on a confidence scale that Anaheim selects Fantilli here. He had a home-run season in the NCAA.</p>
            
            <li> <b> Leo Carlsson, Columbus Blue Jackets </b></li>
            
            <p> Carlsson fits everything Jarmo looks for in the draft. A big center with no. 1 potential? Sign me up.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Will Smith, San Jose Sharks </b></li>
            
            <p> I tried looking at San Jose's track record and I found they like to pick players with a ton of skill. Smith has plenty of it.</p>
            
            <li><b> Ryan Leonard, Montreal Canadiens</b></li>
            
            <p> This one was between Reinbacher and Leonard. Two players that play a physical and skilled hockey style. I went with Leonard because I believe he's the better player.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Dalibor Dvorsky, Arizona Coyotes </b></li>
            
        <p> I'm a firm believer the Coyotes like Dvorsky's style of play. He is dominant at 5v5, has some skill, but lacks footpacing. That is exactly the type of player I expect Arizona to draft. </p>
            
            <li> <b>David Reinbacher, Philadelphia Flyers </b></li>
            
            <p> Reinbacher is the #1 consensus for defensemen at the moment and Philly is in full rebuild mode. He is a great first step at rebuilding their blue-line</p>
            
            <li> <b>Matvei Michkov, Washington Capitals </b></li>
            
            <p> The Capitals aren't scared of drafting Russian players and Michkov is the second best talent in the draft class. I don't think he falls further than this.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Zach Benson, Detroit Red Wings</b></li>
            
            <p> Yzerman plans on drafting the best player available and I think that means Benson or Perreault here. I have them drafting Benson due to his high compete level. </p>
            
            
            <li> <b>Tom Willander, St. Louis Blues</b></li>
            
            <p> St. Louis goes with the biggest riser and one of the smartest players in the draft.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Nate Danielson, Vancouver Canucks </b></li>
            
            <p> Danielson bring intangibles and fits the ideal center mold Vancouver has been looking for behind Pettersson.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Gabe Perreault, Arizona Coyotes </b></li>
            
            <p> Arizona needs defensemen, but I think they get an extraordinary skilled forward in Perreault as BPA.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Dmitri Simashev, Buffalo Sabres </b></li>
            
            <p> Simashev is exactly what Buffalo needs, a big smooth skating defender. They have drafted all their small skilled players already. Time to add size and skating around them.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Daniil But, Pittsburgh Penguins </b></li>
            
            <p> This could've gone a couple of ways. The big Russian is a great piece to start the new chapter for the Penguins. He brings size, skill, and speed.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Axel Sandin-Pelikka, Nashville Predators </b></li>
            
            <p> The Predators are in dire need of high-end defensive prospects. I think Axel is one of the best defenders on the board, so they choose him.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Colby Barlow, Calgary Flames</b></li>
            
            <p> With so many players leaving Calgary, it's time for a culture change with Barlow. Barlow is a safer player with great intangibles. I think he is the perfect fit for the Flames.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Samuel Honzek, Detroit Red Wings</b></li>
            
            <p> Honzek said himself that he thought his interview with the Red Wings was the best one. He is exactly what the Wings are looking for: size, speed, and skill.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Matthew Wood, Winnipeg Jets</b></li>
            
            <p> Wood drops a bit because of his skating, but the Jets are not afraid to draft questionable skaters. Wood is their guy with size and high level playmaking abilities.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Brayden Yager, Chicago Blackhawks</b></li>
            
            <p> Ideally the Hawks draft bigger players to go along with their small skilled forward prospects, but Yager fits their type to a tee.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Oliver Moore, Seattle Kraken </b></li>
            
            <p> Moore likely doesn't fall this far, but the Kraken are happy to take him here. An elite skater that adds to an already explosive team.</p>
            
            <li> <b>David Edstrom, Minnesota Wild </b></li>
            
            <p> Joel Eriksson Ek 2.0, enough said</p>
            
            
            <li> <b>Quentin Musty, Philadelphia Flyers</b></li>
            
            <p> Musty brings such a high level playmaking ability, it is tough for me to see too many teams pass on him. The Flyers nab themselves an offensive dynamo.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Oliver Bonk, New York Rangers </b></li>
            
            <p> The Rangers take a safer and bigger option to surround Adam Fox on the blueline. Bonk is as safe as you can get at this point.</p>
            
    
            <li> <b>Otto Stenberg, Nashville Predators </b></li>
            
            <p> The Predators go with another Swede and add-on to the skill they have been drafting the past couple years.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Oskar-Fisker Molgard, St. Louis Blues</b></li>
            
            <p> Maybe the biggest surprise so far. Oskar is the most NHL ready player left that I can see the Blues targeting.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Calum Ritchie, San Jose Sharks</b></li>
            
            <p> The Sharks go with another skill player down the middle. A team that definitely needs a strong center pipeline.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Tanner Molendyk, Colorado Avalanche</b></li>
            
            <p> It was between Tanner and Mikhail, but I don't think the Aves take a risk on a Russian, so they go with the best skating defender left.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Eduard Sale, Toronto Maple Leafs </b></li>
            
            <p> Sale has the size and skill of a good NHL player. The leafs aren't afraid of swinging for the fences and I think they do that with Sale.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Bradly Nadeau, St. Louis Blues</b></li>
            
            <p> After drafting two safer and more projectible players, I think the Blues go with a high-end skill player with upside. Nadeau brings that to the table. </p>
            
            <li> <b>Charlie Stramel, Carolina Hurricanes</b></li>
            
            <p> Carolina goes after the gritty energy player in Stramel that can elevate their team in the playoffs. </p>
            
            <li> <b>Ethan Gauthier, Montreal Canadiens </b></li>
            
            <p> The Canadiens go for a French winger that brings all the attributes they look for in players: grit, character, and skill.</p>
            
            <li> <b>Carson Rehkopf, Vegas Golden Knights</b></li>
            
            <p> A toolsy player with size is the Golden Knights MO. They continue with that here.</p>
