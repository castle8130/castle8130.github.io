        <h1> Mikhail Gulyayev, D MHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected in the 1st-2nd round </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Gulyayev is the Russian speedster that has been dominant in the MHL this season by scoring 2 goals and 23 assists in 22 MHL games. He went on to put up 10 points in 17 playoff games. Notably, Gulyayev played 12 VHL games where he put up 4 assists and had a +7. He is a real treat to watch. If you were a big Lane Hutson fan of last years draft, you will love Gulyayev. This undersized defensman can skate circles around the opposition and then some. He can turn on a dime, has great agility and skating fundamentals, and is an explosive skater. Scouts are going to knock him down for being small like Lane, but I think that is a mistake. He has already logged pro games as an 18 year old and has fit in relatively well. He is a real mystery in the draft. Scouts have doubts about his defensive game and don't think he will be selected in the top 20. My guess is he will get selected near 30, but I am all here for the upside.

            The one thing Gulyayev needs to do more than anything is work on his strength. It's tough enough being an undersized 18 year old playing against men. Added strength couldn't hurt. Strength will do two important things. Firstly, it will help him in the corners and in his net front battles. These are areas I see him struggle the most in. Grown men really take advantage of him by bullying him in the physical parts of the game. The second thing added muscle will do is increase his top speed to elite. Gulyayev is such a terrific skater, he could be one of the NHL's best skaters with an elite top speed. His smooth and agile skating could reach new heights. His playmaking ability is up there with the best offensive defensemen in the draft class. In the Recrutes videos I have posted they compare him to Cale Makar, but to me, he reminds me of a smaller version of Miro Heiskanen. I see a connection in the way they skate so effortlessly and the decisions they make in the offensive zone. Heiskanen had a better top speed and wrist shot, but other than that, they have plenty of similarities. If your team is lucky enough to draft the small Russian, you are getting a high-upside offensive defenseman.
