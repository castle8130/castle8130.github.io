        <h1> Gavin Brindley, RW NCAA </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Gavin Brindley is a very small winger that played with Adam Fantilli this year for Michigan. He scored 12 goals with 26 assists in 41 games. He also played at the WJC-20 where he posted 4 points in 7 games. He stands at only 5'8", but skates like a kid who just left a candy shop. He is zooming out there and throws his body around constantly. I see him as a future 3rd line winger that can potentially be added to the top 6 if all goes right. While his size isn't enticing, any coach would love to have him. He doesn't fear anyone on the ice and always finishes his body checks. Due to his size, I see him falling anywhere between 28-50. Teams will sometimes avoid players that aren't in the height range they want. I'd take a flyer on him anywhere between 25-40. There are so many good forwards that it makes me want to take someone with higher upside.

            Gavin is a great skater with a really strong compete level. His top speed is good with a really strong first step. He is a non-stop machine that doesn't let off the gas. He produced quite well in the NCAA this year, but I'm unsure of his offensive upside. He has good playmaking skills, but I don't think his offensive hockey IQ is anything to write home about. It's not below average, but it isn't eye-popping either. His goal scoring ability is average too. He is a responsible two-way winger that competes just as hard in his own zone as he does in the offensive zone. I don't have much more to say about him other than the fact that any coach would be happy to have this type of player.
