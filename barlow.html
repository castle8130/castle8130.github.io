        <h1> Colby Barlow, LW OHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected in the top 25 </h2>

            Colby Barlow captained the Owen Sound Attack this year and scored 46 goals and 33 assists in 59 games. His team made the playoffs, but got swept in 4 games. He had 3 goals and no assists in those games. Barlow is close to 6'1" and a solid 195lbs. The one thing you will notice about him is that he is strong. He is a hard guy to push around by your net and has a knack for putting away the garbage near the crease. He has a booming one timer that he uses on the powerplay. He positions himself on the right circle (facing the net) or in front of the net for tips and screens. At the NHL level I see him playing in front of the net. His game reminds me a bit of Tyler Bertuzzi with a little more two-way play. I have heard some rumblings that his character is top notch (he's captain for a reason). Given these intangible's + a versatile toolkit, I think he gets drafted in the 10-23 range. I am more bearish on Barlow. I think he will have a good career as an NHL player, but I wouldn't draft this player type that early because he isn't a game changer (or my style of player).

            Colby Barlow doesn't excel at skating. He is closer to a below average skater than above, but is still good enough to play at the NHL level. When it comes to his skating, Barlow gets his speed from powerful strides. His legs aren't quick, but he moves around the ice just fine. His side to side movement helps him get a lot of goals around the net, but isn't anything extraordinary. Any team needing a goal scoring net front presence will look for Barlow.

            Barlow's bread and butter is in his goal scoring and in tight play. If you are playing a close quarters game, Barlow is a guy you want. He is strong on his stick and wins a lot of battles. His office is in the opposition's house. He makes a lot of noise there and is mighty helpful in his own end. He isn't a great playmaker though. He is the type of guy you throw on a line that already has two players with good chemistry. If your team drafts Barlow, they are getting a net front presence, complimentary forward with strong intangibles.
