        <h1> Axel Sandin-Pelikka, D SWEHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected in the top 25 </h2>
        
        
        
        <p>
            Axel is a Swedish defenseman that played for Skellefta AIK J20 and their SWEHL team. He scored 16 goals 20 assists in 31 games for J20 and 2 goals 3 assists in 22 games in the pros. Axel began the season red hot in the J20 league this year. He was ranked as the top defenseman by most outlets from his dominating play. Then he had a weak performance at the WJC-20 with 1 assist and a -4 in 7 games. Axel's game really shines against his own age group. He is very shifty and can walk the blue line well. His elusive puck carrying skills are what separates himself from most defenders in this class. I think scouts have taken note of his offensive abilities and question some of his habbits away from the puck. He has the opposite issues Simashev has, but they are both puck moving defensemen. My guess is Axel gets drafted anywhere between 11-23. If he fell past 18, I'd consider that a big fall for him. I'm on the less optimistic side of Pelikkas game, so I ranked him lower.

            Axel's top speed is about average, but he is flying on all cylinders in every other area of skating. Edgework, turns, side to side movement, acceleration, you name it. He checks all the skating marks you want in a smaller defenseman. His evasive nature is what really drives him up the ranks of scouts. He seems to always be a step ahead of the players in his age group. Offenisvely, he excels in the scoring department. He scored 16 goals at the j20 level by taking advantage of the open space he was given in that league.

          The part that worries me the most about his game is his strength and defensive play. He has a really hard time with board battles or moving players in front of his net. I know he is very young, but this gives me some concerns about his pro projection. His small stature isn't enticing and he doesn't have a lot of room to fill out. Also, at times he will make poor decisions with the puck under pressure. When heavy pressure is on him, he tends to make mistakes. If your team drafts Axel, they are getting a shifty 5v5 offensive defenseman.
