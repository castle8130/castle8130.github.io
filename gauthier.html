        <h1> Ethan Gauthier, RW QMJHL </h1>
        <h2> Projected 1st-2nd rounder </h2>

            Ethan Gauthier is a gritty right handed right winger from the Sherbrooke Phoenix. He scored 30 goals and 39 assists in 66 regular season games. He then scored 4 goals 7 assists in 11 games in the post season. Gauthier is a talented player with a good frame at 5'11.5" 183lbs. He isn't a tall player by any means, but he plays a lot bigger than his size. He is a hard player to knock of the puck and has good stickhandling abilities. When watching Gauthier, it is easy to see why he is highly touted. It is hard to beat him in corner battles or get him off the puck. He is hard on his stick and is difficult to play against. Scouts have to enjoy watching Gauthier play. He has a lot of the same characteristics that are coveted in the NHL playoffs. Even though Mckenzie's scouts have him ranked towards the end of the first round, I see him getting drafted anywhere in the 2nd round. I'm not as high on him because I'm not a big believer in his skillset and decision making.

            Gauthier's skating ability isn't anything above oridnary. I found his footpacing, edgework, and acceleration fairly mediocre all around. He isn't a player that jumps off the page, but he gives a physical presence that most players don't bring to the game. He has very strong hips that he uses to roll players out along the boards. He wins board battles often and is tough to beat in close quarters. I can see the appeal in drafting this type of player because if he develops a strong offensive skillset, he can be a valuable piece to a cup contender.

            Gauthier's home is in the opposition's crease. He is the player you put in front of the net for tips and screens. He plays the type of game that you'd expect from a guy in the playoffs; pass to the open man, get pucks towards the net, and grind your way to some goals. I have found that he isn't the type of player to take advantage of open space (that you commonly see in the QMJHL). This is the reason I docked his IQ grade down to below average. I'm just not the biggest fan of his offensive instincts or puck skills. He has a long developmental path if he wants to be a star player. If your team drafts Gauthier, you are getting a hard hitting player with potential to be a top 6 player.
